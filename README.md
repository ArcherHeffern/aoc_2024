# Goal 
1. Complete [AOC](https://adventofcode.com/) in C++
2. No external tools may be used to solve problems (GPT, grep, sed, etc)
3. Code must be tasteful

I have no competitive programming experience. Lets see how well I do.

"Time" is measured as time from the problem opening. I.E, problem 2 on day 1 actually took me 11:26-4:24 minutes.
